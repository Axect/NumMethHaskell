Difference equations relating the estimates for the problems of filtering and smoothing are derived as well as a similar set of equations relating the covariance of the errors. The derivation is based on the method of maximum likelihood and depends primarily on the simple manipulation of the probability density functions. The solutions are in a form easily mechanized on a digital computer. A numerical example is included to show the advantage of smoothing in reducing the errors in estimation. In the Appendix the results for discrete systems are formally extended to continuous systems.}},

@article{Moral2015,
abstract = {We propose sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for sampling the posterior distribution of state-space models under highly informative observation regimes, a situation in which standard SMC methods can perform poorly. A special case is simulating bridges between given initial and final values. The basic idea is to introduce a schedule of intermediate weighting and resampling times between observation times, which guide particles towards the final state. This can always be done for continuous-time models, and may be done for discrete-time models under sparse observation regimes; our main focus is on continuous-time diffusion processes. The methods are broadly applicable in that they support multivariate models with partial observation, do not require simulation of the backward transition (which is often unavailable), and, where possible, avoid pointwise evaluation of the forward transition. When simulating bridges, the last cannot be avoided entirely without concessions, and we suggest an approach (reminiscent of Approximate Bayesian Computation) as a workaround. Compared to the bootstrap particle filter, the new methods deliver substantially reduced mean squared error in normalising constant estimates, even after accounting for execution time. The methods are demonstrated for state estimation with two toy examples, and for parameter estimation (within a particle marginal Metropolis–Hastings sampler) with three applied examples in econometrics, epidemiology and marine biogeochemistry.},

In this paper, we consider stochastic extensions in order to capture unknown influences (changing behaviors, public interventions, seasonal effects, etc.). These models assign diffusion processes to the time-varying parameters, and our inferential procedure is based on a suitably adjusted adaptive particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The performance of the proposed computational methods is validated on simulated data and the adopted model is applied to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in England. In addition to estimating the effective contact rate trajectories, the methodology is applied in real time to provide evidence in related public health decisions. Diffusion-driven susceptible exposed infected retired-type models with age structure are also introduced.},

@article{Andrieu2010,
abstract = {Summary. Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability distributions. Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a L{\'{e}}vy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

In our model, the maturation velocity of precursor cells is assumed to be a function of the erythropoietin hormone, and the decay rate of this hormone is assumed to be a function of the number of precursor cells, unlike other models which assume these parameters to be constants. Existence-uniqueness results are established and convergence of a finite difference approximation to the unique solution of the model is obtained. The finite difference scheme is then used to investigate the effects of these nonlinear parameters on the model dynamics. Our results show that a velocity of precursor cells maturation rate which is an increasing function of the hormone level and a decay rate of the hormone which is an increasing function of the number of precursor cells have a stabilizing effect on the dynamics of the model. While assuming that one parameter is a function and letting the other be a constant stabilizes the oscillations in the mature cells level, the effect is more significant when both parameters are taken to be functions. A study of robustness with respect to the forms of these functions and parameter sensitivity is also carried out. "

abstract = {Benzene (C 6 H 6) is a highly flammable, colorless liquid. Ubiquitous exposures result from its presence in gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. Benzene increases the incidence of leukemia in humans when they are exposed to high doses for extended periods; however, leukemia risks in humans subjected to low exposures are uncertain. The exposure-dose-response relationship of benzene in humans is expected to be nonlinear because benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations, detoxifying and activating, resulting in multiple metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. Since benzene is a known human leukemogen, the toxicity of benzene in the bone marrow is of most importance. And because blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, we investigated the effects of benzene on hematopoiesis (blood cell production and development). An age-structured model was used to examine the process of erythropoiesis, the development of red blood cells. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system of coupled partial and ordinary differential equations was proven. In addition, an optimal control problem was formulated for the control of erythropoiesis. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the performance of the optimal feedback law and another feedback function that is based on the Hill function.},
